# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions and answers about Tuxgrade.

## General Questions

### What is Tuxgrade?

Tuxgrade is an automated system upgrade tool for multiple Linux distributions that streamlines updates across various package managers (DNF, APT, Flatpak, Snap, Homebrew) while ensuring system stability, especially for kernel updates and NVIDIA drivers.

**Supported Distributions:**
- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux (dnf)
- Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!_OS/Linux Mint/Zorin OS (apt)
- Arch Linux/EndeavourOS/CachyOS (pacman/paru/yay)

### Why use this instead of just `dnf update` or `apt upgrade`?

Tuxgrade provides:
- **Multi-distribution support**: Works across Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, and more
- **Kernel safety**: Prompts before kernel updates and rebuilds initramfs automatically
- **NVIDIA support**: Automatically rebuilds NVIDIA drivers after kernel updates (Fedora)
- **Sudo management**: Only asks for password once
- **Multi-package manager**: Updates DNF/APT, Flatpak, Snap, and optionally Homebrew in one command

### Is this safe to use?

Yes. The script:
- Prompts for confirmation before kernel updates
- Uses well-tested package managers (DNF, APT, Flatpak, Snap, etc.)
- Has been used in production on multiple systems
- Is based on a mature Bash script (v1.x)
- Has comprehensive test coverage

### Can I use this on other Linux distributions?

Yes! Tuxgrade now supports:
- **Fedora Linux 41+**
- **RHEL, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux** (DNF-based)
- **Debian/Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, Zorin OS** (APT-based)
- **Arch Linux, EndeavourOS, CachyOS** (Pacman-based)
- **Other distributions**: Limited functionality via fallback mode

## Installation Questions

### Do I need to install all package managers?

No. The required package manager depends on your distribution:
- **Fedora/RHEL:** DNF is required
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** APT is required
- **Arch:** Pacman is required; Paru/Yay are optional
- **All distros:** Flatpak, Snap, Homebrew, and akmods are optional

The script will skip updates for tools that aren't installed.

### How do I uninstall?

**On Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf remove tuxgrade
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt remove tuxgrade
```

### Can I install from source?

Yes:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lineax17/tuxgrade.git
cd tuxgrade
pip install .
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I run it?

Simply:
```bash
tuxgrade
```

For backward compatibility:
```bash
fedora-update  # Still works as an alias
```



### Does it need sudo?

Yes, but you don't need to run it with `sudo tuxgrade`. The script will prompt for your password once and maintain privileges throughout execution.

### Can I automate it?

Yes, but be careful with kernel updates. You might want to disable the kernel confirmation prompt for automation. See [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md) for details.

### What if I don't want kernel updates?

When prompted for kernel update confirmation, press any key except `y` or `Y`, or press `Ctrl+C`.

### Can I update only specific package managers?

Currently, the script updates all available package managers. You can use the `--brew` flag to optionally include Homebrew. Future versions may add more granular control if many users ask for it.

### How do I save update logs?

```bash
tuxgrade 2>&1 | tee ~/update-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

## Technical Questions

### Why was it rewritten in Python?

- Better error handling and testing
- Type safety with type hints
- Easier to extend and maintain
- More robust subprocess handling

### What Python version is required?

Python 3.10 or higher. This is because we use:
- Modern type hints (`str | None`)
- Match-case statements (if used in future)
- Other Python 3.10+ features

### Does it have dependencies?

No external dependencies. It uses only Python standard library modules:
- `subprocess`
- `argparse`

- `logging`
- etc.

### How is sudo keepalive implemented?

A background thread refreshes the sudo timestamp every 60 seconds using `sudo -n true`. See [sudo_keepalive.md](modules/sudo_keepalive.md) for details.

### Can I contribute?

Yes! See the [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md#contributing) for details.

## Security Questions

### Is it safe to keep sudo active?

The sudo keepalive refreshes privileges every 60 seconds, which is the same timeout as the default sudo configuration. It doesn't bypass security, just prevents re-prompting.

### Can it be exploited?

The script:
- Uses subprocess with list arguments (no shell injection)
- Doesn't accept network input
- Doesn't execute arbitrary code
- Has signal handlers for clean shutdown

### Should I review the code?

Yes! The code is open source. Review it before use:

## Version Questions

### How do I check the version?

```bash
tuxgrade --version
```

### How often are releases made?

Currently on an as-needed basis. Follow the GitHub repository for updates.

### What's the update policy?

- **Patch releases** (2.0.x): Bug fixes, no breaking changes
- **Minor releases** (2.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Major releases** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, major refactoring
